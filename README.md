# 🌱 Day 1 of My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to **Day 1** of my Machine Learning learning journey! 🎯  
Today, I started with the basics of regression using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
I built simple neural network models that learn to map input values to output values using linear relationships.

## 🧠 What I Did

- ✅ Set up TensorFlow and Keras
- ✅ Built and trained simple linear regression models
- ✅ Learned how to:
  - Use `Sequential` models with `Dense` layers
  - Compile models with optimizers and loss functions
  - Train with `.fit()`
  - Predict with `.predict()`
  - Save and load models using `.save()` and `load_model()`
  - Use `os.path.exists()` to check for saved models and avoid retraining

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Training even simple models takes time and tweaking
- Choosing the right loss function is crucial (`mean_squared_error`)
- Saving models helps prevent retraining and saves time
- Consistent practice is key in ML just like in the problems we solved 😉

## 🔖 Notes

This is just the beginning!  
I'll continue documenting my progress daily as I explore deeper into Machine Learning.  
Feel free to fork or star this repo if you want to follow along or try the projects yourself!
